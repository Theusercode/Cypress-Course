00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,710
‫Hello, guys, welcome back to my Cyprus automation and less from zero to Hero, and in this module,

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:25,500
‫we will talk about the object design pattern and we will learn how to organize our test to make it nicer,

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,500
‫more readable and code more reusable.

4
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,870
‫I think you probably heard about the object model object pattern.

5
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,270
‫This is pretty popular topic, IMO, automation engineers.

6
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:44,610
‫And in this module, I will show you how to implement this beach object button for the cypress and we

7
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,670
‫will not use any Cucumber's or any other shells.

8
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,760
‫On the top of that, we will just use JavaScript and Cyprus.

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,510
‫So let's start with creating a new spec gloss, which we will use to write our test using the page object

10
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,350
‫better.

11
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,350
‫So you file.

12
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,350
‫So we created our new file, let's put.

13
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,570
‫Describe.

14
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:25,330
‫All right, this is the body of our test, and let's go to our first tests, bags, and as you remember,

15
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:30,810
‫for each of our tests, we use this visit site visit in each test.

16
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:37,110
‫This is kind of not nice to copy paste the code always when you see the copy paste over the code.

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,640
‫Remember that if you copy paste in any code more than two times, then there is definitely place to

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,420
‫refactoring because we are using site visit in each and every test.

19
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:54,880
‫We want to create some before each hook to repeat site visit for us every time so we will not copy paste

20
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,310
‫this thing again and again.

21
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,410
‫So before each.

22
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:12,950
‫So before every test, this hook will open application for us and then let's right first test and for

23
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,230
‫the beginning, let's ride the test to organize our menu.

24
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,870
‫So as you see, our application has the menu and we you can navigate different pages of our application.

25
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,060
‫So the very first thing we want to organize is the navigation part of our app.

26
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:37,790
‫And let's name this test as the refined navigation across the pages.

27
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,450
‫So let's go back to our previous test, and as you see, for each of every test we copy pasted, the

28
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,890
‫things like site contains forms, layout in the next test, we did the same thing.

29
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,990
‫Site contains Klick, contains the picture, click and so on.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,970
‫And this is something we want probably to reuse, but not copy paste.

31
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:12,000
‫So let's create just a page object which will be responsible for the navigation in this menu and we

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,310
‫will reuse these functions later on.

33
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,420
‫So how to do that?

34
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,730
‫Let's go to our support folder.

35
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,160
‫In the Cypress structure.

36
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,530
‫We will create a new folder and name it page.

37
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:35,270
‫Page objects, and I remind you in the file structure of the files picture folder are created for the

38
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,330
‫fixtures and we will talk about it later.

39
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,410
‫Integration is for the test plugins.

40
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:45,860
‫It's for the plug ins in support folder is for everything else, for all code, which you will need

41
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,380
‫to run your test.

42
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:53,140
‫So we will keep our page objects under this support folder in inside of our objects.

43
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,060
‫We will create new file and we will call it.

44
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,970
‫Navigation page that.

45
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,850
‫This is a new file and let's create a new class inside of this object.

46
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,490
‫And we will need to create a new instance of this class and assign it to the object.

47
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,940
‫So we created a new object of our navigation page, and now let's create a method which will be responsible

48
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,700
‫for navigation, layout, forms, layout.

49
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,860
‫This was the first page we used for our test.

50
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,030
‫So this sign contains form cycling.

51
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,120
‫This is our code.

52
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,830
‫Go back to our objects and let's name it.

53
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,360
‫Form Layout's Beach.

54
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,840
‫And just copy this code over here.

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,180
‫So what else do do we have?

56
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,480
‫And we have former state baker.

57
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,160
‫Let's copy this as well.

58
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,770
‫And this is the bigger picture.

59
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,350
‫All right, we created two methods, each of them responsible for navigation for each of the page.

60
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,360
‫Now let's go to our test and call our object.

61
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:33,230
‫On navigation page for layout page, I don't really like how we name it, let's remain like this,

62
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,840
‫navigate to and we replace this.

63
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,750
‫Navigate to.

64
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:54,860
‫OK, this sounds nice or navigate to forms, layout, page and navigate to the bigger page.

65
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,110
‫OK, let's try.

66
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,130
‫How does it work?

67
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,490
‫OK, look what happened.

68
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:18,580
‫So we were able successfully to navigate to the forms layouts, but when we wanted to click on that

69
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,190
‫picture, that didn't work and why?

70
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,250
‫Because our forms menu was collapsed.

71
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,250
‫Why did that happen?

72
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:33,190
‫Just over here, when we click on the form menu, it's either open the menu form or collapse the menu

73
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,420
‫menu over here.

74
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:41,140
‫And we will go to our methods responsible for navigation, to the forums, layouts or they peaker.

75
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:47,200
‫We see that we first click on the forums and in this example we click on the forums as well, but we

76
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,420
‫actually don't want that.

77
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:57,370
‫So now we need to add some additional logic which will verify if the menu is open or not and if it is

78
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:03,580
‫opened, we want to click on the menu item or if it's not, we want to click on the header for this

79
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,360
‫menu item.

80
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,280
‫In our example, it is for us.

81
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,790
‫Let's go and inspect element and we see what we need to do for it.

82
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,130
‫So this is our form.

83
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:18,130
‫And as we see, we have this small Chevron, which is change his direction.

84
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,390
‫Let's inspect it.

85
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,140
‫And Chevron left.

86
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,880
‫And when we click.

87
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:31,040
‫On the button, inspect the position is Chevron, right?

88
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,150
‫So we probably what we want to do is to grab the value of this name attribute.

89
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:44,010
‫And if this attribute is left, it means that menu is closed.

90
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:48,630
‫We want to click on this menu, otherwise we just won't escape this.

91
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,880
‫So let's write this code right now.

92
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,080
‫And this Chevron is located inside.

93
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:06,390
‫This is a form name, and we see that this menu is a sibling for that and the icon.

94
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,190
‫So we have an icon one and be icon two.

95
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,420
‫And the forms name is located inside of this eye contact.

96
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:21,910
‫So in order to access the second the icon, we have to go in one level up to the anchor tag and then

97
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,500
‫select these CHIBBARO and find this out.

98
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,910
‫So let's do this.

99
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,180
‫So we want to find a.

100
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:51,540
‫So we got the menu and now we will need to find these Chevron left and this is located Underclass Expand

101
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,190
‫State.

102
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,410
‫So these glasses menu icon, this is expen state.

103
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:04,930
‫So we can use this as a unique identifier and we will need this second G over here.

104
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:11,640
‫So what we need is find it to find this.

105
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:19,080
‫Then we need to find first G and second G, then we want to invoke.

106
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,700
‫Attribute is.

107
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,850
‫The name.

108
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,190
‫Attribute the name.

109
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,870
‫Let's go upstairs, then

110
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:53,380
‫attribute and then we want to write something if our attribute.

111
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:04,060
‫Includes left, that means our menu is collapsing.

112
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,100
‫We want Cy.

113
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:18,590
‫Rap menu and click, otherwise, we just skip the if statement and we'll go straight over here.

114
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,320
‫So let's check if this thing will work.

115
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,430
‫Now let's copy this thing.

116
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,550
‫We based it over here.

117
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,320
‫And let's run our test to see if our logic is working.

118
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,760
‫All right, perfect.

119
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,470
‫So, as you see, we were able to select form layout first and then they'd be confirmed.

120
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,270
‫So our code was able to understand if the menu collapsed or not.

121
00:10:54,270 --> 00:11:02,610
‫And if it is not, then we just skip the clicking on the header of the form and select the menu item.

122
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,640
‫Now, let's make small refactoring because we don't want to make this copy paste.

123
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,250
‫Let's extract this method to the reuseable function.

124
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:39,050
‫So what we did is I extracted this checker for the group is collapse or not do a reusable function named

125
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:46,910
‫and select group menu item, and I assign the parameter group name, which I use over here inside contains

126
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,480
‫group name.

127
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:55,640
‫And then I just call our reusable function and provide the group name over here so I can use this function

128
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,110
‫now for any group name inside of our test.

129
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,350
‫So let's run that test and see if it is working.

130
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,130
‫Yes, it is working.

131
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:16,370
‫Sounds good, and all we have to do right now is just to copy the rest of the methods which we used

132
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,300
‫for navigation.

133
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,920
‫And and we will be able to complete our first object navigation page.

134
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:09,430
‫All right, I think we're done organizing this, so we created five methods to navigate across different

135
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,320
‫pages is tooltip page, smart table page Towcester Picker and forms layout.

136
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:21,940
‫Now, let's go back to our test with page objects and let's just navigate to these pages, OK?

137
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:27,670
‫Navigate to date picture forms, layout, smart table page.

138
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:36,310
‫And now you see how it is it comfortable to find where we want to navigate Towcester page, tooltip

139
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:43,670
‫tooltip page and navigate to what was left Towcester page.

140
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,630
‫OK, and let's run this test and we'll check our navigation.

141
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,420
‫All right, perfect.

142
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,600
‫Our navigation across the pages works just fine, and let's quickly summarize what we did in this lesson.

143
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:09,680
‫So in this lesson we used before each vote for the first time, we put there our side that visit to

144
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,060
‫open our application.

145
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,490
‫And this code will be executed for every test in these described blocks.

146
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:24,980
‫So in this test class and we created our first page object, which is navigation page object, and put

147
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:31,750
‫there a few methods in each of the methods responsible for navigation for certain page.

148
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,610
‫And we created one reusable function, which we are using only for these methods.

149
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,990
‫And this function is responsible to determine the state of the main menu.

150
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,660
‫Is it opened or collapsed?

151
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,900
‫So our navigation across the pages will work just fine.

152
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:55,520
‫And we created a very simple first test which will verify that we can successfully navigate across our

153
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,310
‫pages and we are using page objects.

154
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,110
‫Better to do that.

155
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,460
‫It was the part one.

156
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,560
‫In the second part, we will run more test using page objects.
