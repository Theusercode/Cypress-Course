‫Hello, everyone, my name is Artem, I'm ALLETE Automation engineer and signify health and a welcome

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,470
‫to my class Cyprus from zero to Hero.

3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,660
‫I have many years experience of hands on experience in this automation of a different selenium based

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,220
‫frameworks.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,210
‫But when I switched to Cyprus, I like it so much and don't want to go back to selenium anymore.

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:34,660
‫It's faster, more reliable and overall easier to use so I can write my tests faster and getting consistent

7
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,600
‫result of the test from Weisler in Cyprus.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,570
‫I have found out that there are not so many well organized video tutorials about how to use this framework

9
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,280
‫and implement its best practices.

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:51,010
‫So I decided to create my own class, how to build lessons in the logical order, starting from the

11
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,860
‫basics and increasing complexity for listen to listen.

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,580
‫Also, I understand the value of your time spent on the lessons.

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:03,040
‫So I try to efficiently organize all content for maximum productivity during the education process.

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,880
‫And no worries, no prior programming skills required.

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,610
‫If this will be your first framework for automating applications and you don't have experience with

16
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,950
‫selecting a Web driver, it's totally fine.

17
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:22,060
‫In the beginning of the class, we will install the application under the Cyprus framework and we will

18
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,500
‫make needed configuration.

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,120
‫In the second module.

20
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:31,060
‫We will learn the concepts how to find any web elements using Cyprus based on the variety of real life

21
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:37,300
‫example, how to interact with the different types of web elements such as lists, dropdown swept tables,

22
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:43,840
‫input fields and buttons, dialog boxes, check boxes, radio buttons they select and so on.

23
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,640
‫And of course, we will learn how to make assertions for third module.

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,080
‫We'll be about organizing and reusing our code with the beach object design partner.

25
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,180
‫In the fourth module, we will learn how to work with APIs.

26
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,210
‫And if you don't know what the API is, we will talk about it as well.

27
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,880
‫And the last module will be about advanced topics such as environment configurations, reporting and

28
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,440
‫running tests with docker container.

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,050
‫By the end of this class, you will have all needed knowledge and skills to automate pretty much any

30
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:20,320
‫web application use using Cyprus in I.T., there is always room to grow and you will have a solid foundation

31
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,130
‫to move forward.

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,680
‫And if you will have any question, you're in the class.

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,990
‫You can always reach me out and I will definitely provide the support ready for this exciting journey

34
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,570
‫during the class and see you in the classroom.
