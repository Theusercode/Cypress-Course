00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,140
‫Hello, guys.

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,390
‫Welcome back to the class.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,010
‫Cyprus from zero to hero.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:20,070
‫And in this lesson we will clone and run test application that we're going to use for this class.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,100
‫So the first thing, let's create a new folder on our computer where we will keep our code.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,060
‫Just for this demo.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,790
‫I'm going to create a new folder on the desktop, but you can create it anywhere on your computer where

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,910
‫you normally keep your documents or keep your code.

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,040
‫If you already have folder on your computer where you keep the source code for other applications,

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,370
‫you can use that folder just to keep everything organized.

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,810
‫So I create a new folder and let's name it, let's say git repo.

12
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,880
‫Now we need to open this folder in the terminal If you are on my computer.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,510
‫One way of doing this is just right click of the mouse services and new terminal at this folder and

14
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,890
‫the terminal is open.

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,350
‫Another option you can go to Spotlight search.

16
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,760
‫Find your terminal.

17
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,840
‫Open the terminal and then simply navigate to this folder.

18
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,000
‫CD.

19
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,980
‫Desktop git repo.

20
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:22,840
‫And that's it.

21
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:28,400
‫So as you can see, we are right now inside of this folder, if you are on Windows computer, you do

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,510
‫pretty much the same.

23
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,130
‫You will need to find a command prompt terminal on your windows computer.

24
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,300
‫You just go to the start menu search bar and type there command prompt.

25
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:45,770
‫Then you do pretty much the same thing using the commands CD space and providing the path to the folder

26
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,210
‫where it is located.

27
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,020
‫You need to open this folder in the terminal.

28
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,850
‫So that's the step one.

29
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,270
‫Step number two, we open the browser and go to the GitHub.

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:07,610
‫On the GitHub on the search bar we are searching for in g x Cyprus test.

31
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,790
‫And the very first repository is the one that we are looking for.

32
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,330
‫Bonder Artem Inks Cyprus Test.

33
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,290
‫This is our test project.

34
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:22,330
‫Also on Udemy, you can find a link to this repository attached to this lesson.

35
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,230
‫Just click on the resources and here is the link GitHub repository.

36
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,330
‫Click on that and you will be navigated to GitHub.

37
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,320
‫So here we need to click on the code button.

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,340
‫And then copy this URL.

39
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,990
‫Just simply click on this icon and the entire URL will be copied.

40
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:49,710
‫Then we go in back to our terminal and type in the command git space, clone space, and we paste the

41
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:53,550
‫URL that we copied from the GitHub and click enter.

42
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,130
‫That's it.

43
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:01,200
‫The project is closed to this folder, and now we just need to open Visual Studio code and open the

44
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,190
‫folder that we just copied.

45
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:13,050
‫This is Visual Studio code, Open file, open folder, and I'm going to the desktop desktop git repo

46
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:20,610
‫in Cyprus test and make sure that you pick the root of this folder in Cyprus test and click open.

47
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:21,940
‫Here we go.

48
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,100
‫Application is open.

49
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,650
‫We can see the folder structure on the left.

50
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,740
‫Now the next step we need to install all the dependencies required for this application to actually

51
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,360
‫run it on our computer.

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,500
‫We need to open a new terminal, click on the terminal, new terminal and inside of the open terminal.

53
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:50,280
‫Need to run command and PM space install space dash, dash force and click enter.

54
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:58,410
‫So now node package manager is done loaded all required dependencies to run this application.

55
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:04,290
‫So not package manager looking into this package that JSON file and from this dependency section in

56
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,660
‫the loading, all the required packages.

57
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:14,940
‫We used a dash dash force flag because sometimes on your system you may have some conflicts or warnings

58
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,080
‫because of the conflict with some of the packages that already installed in your computer.

59
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,410
‫In order to avoid that, we just want to bypass this.

60
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:28,680
‫Bypassing a false flag installation process may take a few minutes, so you just need to patiently wait

61
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,220
‫until it will be completed so it can take like several minutes.

62
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,540
‫All right.

63
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,570
‫An installation is completed at the end of the installation.

64
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,700
‫You may see a window, something like that.

65
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,460
‫That new major version is available.

66
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,980
‫Also, you will see the message like that that some vulnerabilities are found, but just ignore this

67
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,520
‫message.

68
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,210
‫It's related to some of the packages are just not up to date.

69
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:04,580
‫And because this application is used in Angular eight, some of the packages simply cannot be updated

70
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,570
‫to the higher version.

71
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,690
‫And that's why NPM just showing these kind of warnings.

72
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,100
‫But this is okay for us.

73
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,870
‫All we need is just to run this application on the local host and that's it.

74
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:22,820
‫The next step to run this application is execute command in PM, start and click enter.

75
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,930
‫And we can see application is building and compiling.

76
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:32,830
‫All right.

77
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,380
‫And we see a message compiled successfully.

78
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,850
‫This is what we are looking for.

79
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,750
‫And also open your browser on local host 4200.

80
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,400
‫And this is what we need to do.

81
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:51,490
‫Going back to the Chrome browser, opening a new tab and type in local host 4200.

82
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,780
‫And click enter.

83
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,240
‫Here we go.

84
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,740
‫This is our test application.

85
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,270
‫It's successfully running.

86
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,130
‫It has a different pages.

87
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:04,350
‫As you can see, we will use for this class like forms, layout, date picker to practice different

88
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:10,140
‫types of UI elements and how to interact with those types of web elements using Cyprus.

89
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:10,770
‫All right.

90
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:15,270
‫So the next step will be to install Cyprus and we will do it in the next lesson.
