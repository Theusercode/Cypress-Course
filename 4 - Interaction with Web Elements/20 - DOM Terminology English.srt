00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:19,440
‫Hello, guys, welcome to my Cyprus automation, plus from zero to Hero, and before we start all automation

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,100
‫process and learn how to automate Web application with a Cyprus, first of all, I would like to clarify

3
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,040
‫the terminology which we will use to automate any Web application.

4
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,840
‫You should clearly understand how to locate any Web element on the Web page.

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,630
‫And in order to do that, you should know what the DOM is and how to navigate against the dump.

6
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,980
‫So if we make it right, click and inspect element.

7
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,750
‫This is Chrome developer tools of our application on our test and you will see the HTML structure over

8
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,170
‫here.

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:03,690
‫So this is our DOM and you should be very, very confident in how to find Web elements over here.

10
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,710
‫So we will discuss right now the DOM or HTML structure consists of.

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:18,240
‫So you will be very clear how to navigate in HTML and finally cater for any element in HTML.

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,010
‫And I would like to talk about it on this example of a simple HTML code for input email field.

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,740
‫So let's analyze what it consists of.

14
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,260
‫One of the biggest problem which I have noticed for the automation engineers is the find web elements.

15
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:43,740
‫And this problem come out of the not clear understanding of what is the naming of each HTML field and

16
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,900
‫each HTML value.

17
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:53,580
‫And that creates a confusion how to create the correct locators in any automation tool like selenium

18
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,040
‫or especially Cyprus.

19
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,330
‫I would like to clarify that for you.

20
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,780
‫So let's start with HTML.

21
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:08,430
‫So HTML structure has a HTML tags and these tags called HTML tag name.

22
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:17,880
‫Usually HTML tags come in pairs with open enclosing deck for example, is deep is open text and D with

23
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,740
‫a forward slash is a closed deck.

24
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,730
‫And this is the input html tag which do not have close.

25
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,930
‫InTech is just have this angle brace which is close in this tack.

26
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:37,740
‫Inside of the HTML tag are HTML attributes which are in Chrome browser highlighted in red and they called

27
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:49,200
‫HTML attribute names in HTML attributes has value and they are usually highlighted in blue and sometimes

28
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,490
‫HTML attributes can have values and sometimes they are not.

29
00:02:53,490 --> 00:03:02,190
‫And for example, this HTML attribute name placeholder has a value email or type attribute, has a value

30
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,390
‫email as well.

31
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:10,860
‫But and be input h html attribute do not have value, but it is attribute as well.

32
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:21,630
‫Also important thing to note that ID and the class are also HTML attribute names, IDs and classes has

33
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:28,930
‫a special role in HTML structure because ID is a unique identifier of the web element and class is defined

34
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:36,480
‫the stylesheet, but it is also attribute names and we will talk about the special roles of ID and classes

35
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,960
‫later.

36
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,820
‫Also, a class name has a values and important to understand that these long class, for example, is

37
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,480
‫not one value.

38
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,050
‫This class has three different values.

39
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,120
‫Glossolalia number one, plus value number two and number three in full.

40
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,150
‫Waithe size medium in Chaib rectangle are three different class values and they are separated by this

41
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,490
‫space.

42
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:08,970
‫This is also important to know because you can use each of these class name, size, medium or shape

43
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,050
‫rectangle or as a separate locator by class name.

44
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:19,310
‫Next thing, let's talk about another example of HTML.

45
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,690
‫This is the code for Table, which has a table book body.

46
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,190
‫We have a three table rows one, two, three and four.

47
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,450
‫The first table row.

48
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,560
‫We have three columns as table down, one, two, three, four.

49
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:44,100
‫And let's talk about it as well as we talk before, each HTML tags usually has open index and close

50
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,610
‫index.

51
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:53,250
‫In this particular example for table column TD Tag has the closing tag at the end for the table or in

52
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,090
‫table body.

53
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,870
‫They are located in the bottom just because they are opened over here.

54
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,580
‫The values.

55
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:06,240
‫Between angle braces, in this example, one point eight m.b deer or five.

56
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,540
‫This is the regular text value.

57
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:16,070
‫So everything what you see on the Web page as a text usually located in between the angle braces.

58
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:16,790
‫Why?

59
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,040
‫I say usually because not always.

60
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:26,030
‫Sometimes this text can be hidden in the properties of the browser and we will talk about this later

61
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:31,610
‫and how to work with the properties and how to get the values and assertive values from the properties.

62
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:39,140
‫But in most of the cases, all the text you see on the webpage is located in between the angle basis

63
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,520
‫of HTML tags.

64
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,030
‫The small three dots means that there is some nested content inside.

65
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:54,380
‫And also you can understand by these small icon one, the small arrow turned right.

66
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,000
‫It means that some content is inside of this column.

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,630
‫And if you will click in the inspector in the chrome dev tools on this small icon, it will open for

68
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,980
‫you this content.

69
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,860
‫Also, let's talk about the relations between the Web elements.

70
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:22,580
‫Let's use this table roll with the first table row of our table as our key element, all elements located

71
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,600
‫above our key element, our parent elements.

72
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:36,200
‫So table body HTML tag is a parent element for table roll and all other elements which will be above

73
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,040
‫the table body and up will be parent elements.

74
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:49,970
‫All elements which are located inside of the table role are child elements in relation to table row

75
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,440
‫elements and everything.

76
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,890
‫What is inside of table role?

77
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:59,090
‫All elements which will go deep into the tree is considered a child elements.

78
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:07,900
‫Sibling elements are elements which are located in the same level of the structure, for example, these

79
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:15,190
‫table roles for roles, if you draw the straight vertical line, you will see that they're aligned and

80
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,170
‫they are siblings to each other.

81
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:25,810
‫We have four columns, table downs, which are siblings, and we have three table roles which are also

82
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,520
‫siblings to each others.

83
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,740
‫So this relation of Web elements to each other, you should really clear, understand and let's make

84
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,830
‫a quick summary of what we just discussed in this lesson.

85
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:46,600
‫HTML contains of HTML tags, HTML attributes and attribute values.

86
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:55,460
‫Class and Idy are also attribute names, despite they have a special role in the structure.

87
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:05,020
‫Glass attributes can have a several values in each value is separated by the space HTML tags usually

88
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,080
‫come in pairs of open and enclosed deck close.

89
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:17,830
‫Intec has the same name and forward slash value in between angle brackets is a plaintext elements above

90
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,400
‫the key web element are parent elements.

91
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:28,810
‫Elements inside of the key web element are child elements and elements placed at the same level.

92
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,140
‫Side by side are sibling elements to each other.

93
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,530
‫So this is pretty much it.

94
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:41,470
‫I hope it was useful and we will use all this information in all this knowledge in our next lesson,

95
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,380
‫where will we discuss how to build the locators and how to find the locators in the cypress?

96
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,360
‫So see you in the next lesson.
